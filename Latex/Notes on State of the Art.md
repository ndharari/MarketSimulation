> ==Slowly, over the last three or more decades, a feeling has grown among economists that their key assumptions of perfect rationality, equilibrium, diminishing returns, and of  independent agents always facing well-defined problems are  somehow not trustworthy, too restrictive, somehow forced.==

> the world is not a perfectly ordered system reducible in principle to mathematical equations,

> hey view the economy as a system not necessarily in  equilibrium, but as one where agents constantly change their actions and strategies in response to the outcome they mutually create, a system where agents are constantly creating an “ecology” of behaviors they must mutually adapt to.==

> That much was clear, but we had li3ttle success in reducing the market to a set of condition-action rules, despite a number of attempts. The model was too ad-hoc, I thought—it wasn’t clean. Tom Sargent happened to be visiting from Stanford and he suggested that we simply use Robert Lucas’s classic 1978 model of the stock market as a basis for what we were doing. This worked. It was both clean and doable.  Lucas’s model of course was mathematical; it was expressed in equations. For ease of analysis, his investors had been identical; they responded to market signals all in the same way and on average correctly, and Lucas had managed to show mathematically how a stock’s price over time would vary with its recent sequence of earnings.

> Our investors, by contrast, would potentially differ in their ideas of the market and they would have to learn what worked in the market and what didn’t.

> but when all this worked we saw little at first sight that was different from the standard economic outcome. But then looking more closely, we noticed the emergence of real market phenomena: small bubbles and crashes were present

> Our idea was not to try to lay out a new general method for economics, as Samuelson and others had tried to do several decades before. Rather we would take known problems, the old chestnuts of economics, and redo them from our different perspective.

> I’d summed up my earlier understanding in a 1999 article in Science,6 and the editor insisted I give this different approach a name. ==I called it “complexity economics.” Looking back now, the features of complexity economics are clear. The economy is not necessarily in equilibrium; in fact it is usually in nonequilibrium. Agents are not all knowing and perfectly rational; they must make sense of the situations they are in and explore strategies as they do this. The economy is not given, not a simple container of its  technologies; it forms from them and changes in structure as this happens. In this way the economy is organic, one layer forms on top of the previous ones==

> ==Complexity economics builds on the proposition that the economy is not necessarily in equilibrium: economic agents (firms, consumers, investors) constantly change their actions and strategies in response to the outcome they mutually  create.==

> These emerge probabilistically, last for some time and dissipate, and act at the “meso-level” of the economy (between the micro- and macro-levels). 

> Complexity economics thus sees the economy as in motion, ==perpetually “computing” itself—==

> Complexity, in other words, asks how individual behaviors might react to the pattern they together create, and how that pattern would alter itself as a result. 

> And so ==economics early in its history took a simpler approach, one more amenable to mathematical analysis.== It asked not how agents’ behaviors would react to the aggregate patterns these created, but what behaviors (actions, strategies, expectations) would be upheld by—would be consistent with—the aggregate patterns these caused. ==It asked, in other words, what patterns would call for no changes in micro-behavior, and would therefore be in stasis, or equilibrium.==

> The first thing to observe is that ==in asking “how agents might react to,” we are implicitly assuming nonequilibrium,== for if novel reactions are possible they will alter the outcome, so by definition it cannot be an equilibrium.

> To the degree that outcomes are unknowable, the decision problems they pose are not well-defined. It follows that  ationality— pure deductive rationality—is not well-defined either, for the simple reason that there cannot be a logical solution to a problem that is not logically defined. It

> One way to model this is to suppose economic agents form individual beliefs (possibly several) or hypotheses—internal models—about the situation they are in and continually update these, which means they constantly adapt or discard and replace the actions or strategies based on these as they explore.8 They proceed in other words by induction (Holland et al., 1986; Sargent, 1993; Arthur, 1994a).

> To state this in another way, formally, we can say that the economy is an ongoing computation—a vast, distributed, massively parallel, stochastic one.11 Viewed this way, the economy becomes a system that evolves procedurally in a series of events; it becomes algorithmic.

> A fundamental theorem in computation (Turing, 1936) tells us that in general (if we choose an algorithm randomly) there is no way—no systematic analytical method—to tell in advance whether that algorithm or computer program will halt (as opposed to going on forever, or cycling). Since we could arrange that an algorithm halt if its output fulfilled some particular set of mathematical conditions or reached a given “solution,” in general we cannot tell that that will be the case either. ==In other words there is no analytical method to decide in advance what a given algorithm will do==

> And in many cases we can construct simpler toy models of a phenomenon that capture its essential features and allow us to use mathematics or stochastic theory to study it. The objective, we should remember, is not necessarily to formulate equations or to arrive at necessary conditions. The objective, as it is with all theory, is to obtain general insights.

> We can now begin to see how such phenomena—or order, or structures, if you like—connect with complexity. Complexity, as I said, is the study of the consequences of interactions; it studies patterns, or structures, or phenomena, that emerge from interactions among elements—particles, or cells, or dipoles, or agents, or firms.

> of large movements, similar to critical transitions that are so characteristic for complex evolving systems. These large changes of global financial markets can hardly be viewed as a rational response to news about economic fundamentals and cannot be explained by traditional representative rational agent macro-finance models.
>

> The most important difference between economics and the natural sciences is perhaps the fact that ==decisions of economic agents today depend upon their expectations or beliefs about the future==
>

> The predictions, expectations or beliefs of consumers, firms and investors about the future state of the economy are part of the “law of motion.”
>

> Since the introduction of rational expectations by Muth (1961) and its popularization in macroeconomics by Lucas (1972a and b) and others, the rational expectations hypothesis (REH) became the dominating expectations formation paradigm in economics. According to the REH all agents are rational and take as their subjective expectation of future variables the objective prediction by economic theory. In economic modeling practice, expectations are given as the mathematical conditional expectation given all available information. Rational agents do not make “systematic mistakes” and their expectations are, on average, correct. The REH provides an elegant “fixedpoint” solution to an economic expectations feedback system by imposing that, on average, expectations and realizations coincide.
>

> But how can agents have rational expectations or perfect foresight in a complex, nonlinear world, when the true law of motion is unknown and prices and quantities move irregularly on a strange attractor exhibiting sensitivity to initial conditions? A boundedly rational world view with agents using simple forecasting strategies
>

> common assumption underlying models of bounded rationality is that agents do not know the actual “law of motion” of the economy, but instead base their forecasts upon time series observations. They behave like economic statisticians, forming expectations based upon time series observations, using a simple statistical model for their perceived law of motion. Adaptive learning, sometimes also referred to as statistical learning, means that agents adapt their beliefs over time by updating the parameters of their perceived law of motion according to some learning scheme

> This book focusses on “simple” complexity models, where only a few different types of heterogeneous agents interact. Our main focus is on the role of behavioral rationality and heterogeneous expectations within stylized complexity models. ==Our consistency story of bounded rationality contains three important elements: (i) agents use simple decision rules, with an intuitive behavioral interpretation; (ii) agents switch between different decision rules based on evolutionary selection and learning; and (iii) the models of bounded rationality are empirically validated, at both the micro and the macro levels.==
>

> Two forms of learning further discipline the class of decision heuristics. First, we use the heterogeneous strategy switching framework of Brock and Hommes (1997a, 1998) of endogenous evolutionary selection or reinforcement learning among heterogeneous decision or forecasting rules. The main idea here is that agents tend to switch to rules that have performed better
>

> The forecasting rules may be divided into different classes, with different degrees of rationality, ranging from simple behavioral rules such as naïve or adaptive expectations, trend extrapolating rules or contrarian rules, to more sophisticated rules, such as statistical learning rules, fundamental market analysis or even rational expectations. These more sophisticated rules may be more costly – due to information-gathering costs – than alternative forecasting heuristics

A simple behavioral model, with agents gradually switching to better performing heuristics, explains individual, as well as emergent, macro behavior in these laboratory economies.

> We explore ==families of heuristic rules for individual price-setting behavior and the resulting market patterns, through simulations of agent-based models and laboratory experiments==

> Overall, ==the individual pricing strategies observed experimentally can be represented approximately by a sales-based simple rule.== In the experiments, average market prices tend to converge from above and approach a state resembling a steady state, with slow aggregate price variations and low price dispersion around an average near the competitive level

> ==The Bertrand–Edgeworth (BE) oligopoly, where price-setting, capacity-constrained firms compete for customers, provides a fair approximation of several markets,== especially in the retail sector. The basic form of that scenario is easily described. In a “Marshallian short-run”, where the number of suppliers and their respective productive sizes are given, each firm operates under constant marginal costs, up to the bound established by a capacity constraint which determines a maximum volume of goods which can be produced or kept in store. ==These firms post prices that signal their willingness to sell, conditional on the capacity restriction, to customers who seek to buy at the lowest available price and who, to focus the analysis on the behavior of firms, can be assumed to know all posted prices a==

> We consider the market for a ==non-storable good. Supply is generated by N firms, subject to a constant unit cost and a fixed upper limit on production==. For the sake of the analysis, firms are assumed to be identical in their cost and maximum-output parameters. Sellers post prices before the beginning of the market period, knowing only their own past decisions (prices)and performance (sales, profits). As a simplifying assumption, firms are not informed about the variables pertaining to theircompetitors.

> ==The first of these heuristic rules consists of a straightforward reaction to realized sales, by raising the price if the quantity demanded in the last period has reached the capacity limit, and lowering the price in the opposite case.==
>
> Thus, this simple heuristics generates a movement to a “dynamic equilibrium” where the system shows a permanent variability of individual prices, while the average price and volume of sales gravitates towards a constant value.

> **Initialisation:** Choose the scenario, the search range and the number of rounds of trading.
> **Output:** Price, quantity, industry size and cumulative number of new shops are recorded at rounds
> 4, 8, 20, 28 and 40 (i.e. at the end of year 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10). For the first run, the results for all
> rounds are plotted. All the results, including the plots, are sent to a csv file.

> **Digital world model**
> **Purpose:** The aim of the model is to highlight the difference between traditional markets and those for
> digital information. In particular, there are no capacity constraints and, for simplicity, no costs.
> **Entities:** There are two types of agents: consumers and sellers.
> **Stochastic processes:**
>
> 1. ==Consumers are located at random across the world and are allocated a ‘WTP’ randomly from

>
> 2. ==Sellers are also distributed at random across the world and are allocated initial prices randomly,

>1. The mean of the initial mean price.
> 2. The price reduction % and undercut % per round: they can be zero.
> 3. The standard deviation of the consumers’ WTP.
> 4. The number of runs and rounds required.

> The second model, based on shops, increased the number of suppliers, thus enabling more interaction between them, and introduced consumers, with whom they all interacted. ==The shops adjusted both their capacity and prices. Unprofitable shops went out of business and were replaced by new ones==, keeping the total number unchanged. The model could reproduce the observed birth and death rate of British retailers (as the actual birth and death rates are similar). ==The model could also replicate perfect competition, and this was used as a baseline against which to measure the performance of alternative market structures.== The results of this simple model were consistent with the view that the further away the market is from perfect competition, the lower is the output. 
> 
> Finally, ==the digital world model== was designed to highlight the differences between markets for physical products and the markets for digital information. The former are ==characterised by constant or falling returns to scale, while the latter are characterised by low costs and even increasing returns to scale.== It was assumed, for simplicity and contrast, that there were ==no capacity constraints and that sellers adjusted their prices to gain market share.== The analysis suggested that price undercutting can produce very variable outcomes in terms of total industry revenue and consumers’ adoption. It also showed why sellers should start by pricing high and the impact of the initial price on the life of the market for the product.

>  patterns emerge as the unintended out-come of the interaction of various units that follow simple rules

> Complexity is concerned with how these units process information,adapt and evolve along with the structures they create. The type of dynamics associated with such systems may entail non periodic fluctuations, overlapping waves and regime change

> Last but not least, the complexity approach may help rethink development policies. Looking at the economy as an evolving complex system leads to emphasize a more flexible approach to development policy, in which “inevitably, the ecosystem will involve a combination of bottom-up dynamics and top-down influence, and a central part of the social policy debate needs to be about how top-down influence and bottom-up dynamics influence each other” (Colanderand Kuper, 2014, p. 20). The central question is not how to centrally impose a desired structure, but how to devise rules and norms thatre shape interactions in such a way that the emerging structure is consistent with development goals.

> First, they all shared a rejection for the two fundamental pillars of mainstream (neoclassical) economics, namely ==maximization at micro level, and equilibrium at aggregate one.== Rather, the central theoretical quest has been the  identification and sometimes the formalization of “laws of motion” of the system, while quite  agnostic, or even skeptical about possible microfoundation

> ==Agent-based models typically possess the following structure. There is a population – or a set of populations – of agents (e.g., consumers, firms, etc.), possibly hierarchically organized, whose number may change or not over time. The evolution of the system is observed in discrete time steps, $t = 1, 2, . . . $.  Time steps may be days, quarters, years, etc.. At each $t$, every agent $i$ is characterized by a finite number of time-varying micro-economic variables $x_{i,t}$ (e.g. wealth, technology, capital) and by a vector of micro-economic parameters $              \theta_i$ (e.g. mark-ups). Finally, there are also some macroeconomic parameters $\Theta$, which often can be related to different policies (e.g. tax rate, unemployment subsidy rate, etc.).==
>
> Given some initial conditions $x_{i,0}$ (e.g. income distribution, technology, etc.) and a choice for micro and macro parameters, at each time step $t > 0$, one or more agents are chosen to update their micro-economic variables. This may happen randomly or can be triggered by the state of the system itself.

> As the economy is by definition out-of-equilibrium in ABMs, one must look for long-run statistical equilibria and/or emergent properties of aggregate dynamics.

> the K+S model embeds the Schumpeterian growth paradigm into a complex system of imperfect coordination among heterogeneous interacting firms and banks, wherein Keynesian (demand-related) and Minskian (credit cycle) elements feed back into the meso and macro dynamics.

> This work presents an evolutionary model of output and investment dynamics yielding endogenous business cycles. The model describes an economy composed of firms and consumers/workers. Firms belong to two industries. The first one performs R&D and produces heterogeneous machine tools. Firms in the second industry invest in new machines and produce a homogenous consumption good

> In our view, both RBC and NK theories share two serious weaknesses. First, both streams of literature dramatically underestimate the role of endogenous technological shocks occurring at the microeconomic level. Second both RBC and NK explanations show a persistent clash between the microeconomics that one assumes in the models and the regularities in microeconomic behaviors that one empirically observes.1

> In this paper, we try to bridge such gaps by proposing an evolutionary model where both output and investment dynamics are grounded upon lumpy investment decisions undertaken by boundedly-rational firms

> We present an agent-based computational economics (ACE) model of the wholesale fish market in Marseille. ==Two of the stylized facts of that market are high loyalty of buyers to sellers, and persistent price dispersion.== In our ACE model, sellers decide on quantities to supply, prices to ask, and how to treat loyal customers, while buyers decide which sellers to visit, and which prices to accept. ==Learning takes place through reinforcement.== The model explains both stylized facts price dispersion and high loyalty. In a coevolutionary process, buyers learn to become loyal as sellers learn to offer higher utility to loyal buyers, while these sellers, in turn, learn to o!er higher utility to loyal buyers as they happen to realize higher gross revenues from loyal buyers

> if we want to understand the dynamics of interactive market processes, and the emergent properties of the evolving market structures and outcomes, it might pay to analyze explicitly how agents interact with each other, how information spreads through the market, and how adjustments in disequilibrium take place.

> ==The seller, then, informs him about the price. Prices are not posted, and they are individual in a threefold sense. First, each individual  seller decides upon his own prices. Second, each seller may have diferent prices for diferent buyers.== Third, each seller may even ask a diferent price for a given type and quantity of "fish if that is demanded by the same buyer at diferent times of the day. A price communicated by an individual seller to an individual buyer for a given transaction is not perceived by other buyers or sellers in the market. ==The prices are 'take-it-or-leave-it' prices, and there is essentially no bargaining.== At the end of the day, unsold "fish is thrown away, or disposed of in return for minimal compensation. Some species can be offered for sale on the succeeding day. Buyers are, however, capable of recognizing the freshness of the "fish. Typically, on most days the market clears or gets very close to clearing.

> ==In contrast to the natural sciences, in the social sciences `(e)xperimentation is impossible, and we have therefore no knowledge of definite regularities in the complex phenomena== in the same sense as we have in the natural sciences" (Hayek, 1948b, p. 126). 
>
> Economics yields no natural laws or universal constants.6 Therefore, as Hayek (1948a) put it, what we need to do is, `construct hypothetical models in an attempt to reproduce the patterns of social relationships which we know in the world around us"

> As we explained, ==the output of an ACE computer program are not artifacts to be explained. The computer program itself is the model that explains the social facts.== In fact, an ACE model stands to executing its program
> as a mathematical model stands to solving its equations. ==The only, and essential, reason to execute the computer program of an ACE model is to carry out the consistency checks.== The idea that it is not possible to test the truth of a social theory, and that the best we can aim for is doing consistency checks, resembles Friedman's (1953) "as if " argument

> Every model is by definition an abstraction, and if enough data can be collected, statistical testing will reject any model. The only way to avoid this would be to create a copy of the real market. ==Therefore, we will not try to build an ACE model "tting all aspects of the Marseille "sh market. We will only consider speci"c questions concerning the stylized facts of the real market that appear remarkable or important.== We will build an ACE model that explains those stylized facts, suggesting ways to understand those phenomena.7

> ==Paradoxically, the sort of macroeconomic models which claim to give a picture of economic reality (albeit a simplified picture) have almost no activity which needs such coordination.== This is because typically they ==assume that the choices of all the diverse agents in one sector-consumers for example-can be considered as the choices of one "representative" standard utility maximizing individual whose choices coincide with the aggregate choices of the heterogeneous individuals.==

> the easiest way to proceed was simply to assume that the whole economy behaved as one individual. One way
> to justify this was to suggest that, ==even though the agents in the economy might be very heterogeneous, aggregate behavior could effectively be described by the behavior of a "representative" individual.==

> In other words, whenever a representative agent model is tested, one is testing a joint hypothesis: the particular behavioral hypothesis one is interested in and the hypothesis that the choices of the aggregate can indeed be described as the choices of a single utility-maximizing agent.

> ==Heterogeneity of agents, even in the standard general equilibrium model, may be useful in making aggregate behavior more regular.== This result will come as no surprise to those familiar with Cournot's observation that erratic individual demand behavior may give very smooth aggregate demand behavior, if individuals are different enough.

> However, if there are many agents and they all have different preferences, the individual jumps will occur at different prices and will not be enough to disturb the overall continuity of demand.

> Grandmont (1991) has recently obtained a rather remarkable result. He gives an example in which ==if agents have very spread out preferences, then aggregate excess demand will have the well known "gross substitutability" property and equilibria will be unique and stable.== In fact, paradoxically, his result shows the unimportance of individual maximizing behavior to building up well-behaved aggregate demand functions;

> This sort of interaction in an economic system can be envisaged in several ways. ==One might assume that agents meet each other at random and that the subsequent activity of the agents is conditioned by these meetings.==

> ==the market as an institution hardly figures in the theoretical literature.== Indeed, as Douglas North (1977, 710) says, “It is a peculiar fact that the literature on economics . . . contains so little discussion of the central institution that underlies neoclassical economics—the market.”

> ==When Debreu talks about markets, all that he has in mind is that the prices of all goods at all times and in all places should be determined and known to all participants in the economy.== This vector of prices constitutes what he refers to as “market prices.” In particular, he is interested in those prices for which the excess demand is zero for every commodity, and it is these that he refers to as “equilibrium prices,” and in this he follows exactly in Léon Walras’s footsteps

> Debreu says, ==“Agents no longer make independent decisions, and they interact with each other, if there are markets for commodities. Their interaction then reduces the difference between demand and supply.”== But this is precisely the basic weakness of the model. ==Nowhere is there any explanation of how this happens==

> ==There is a rather arid economic environment referred to as a purely competitive market in which individuals receive signals as to the prices of all goods. All the individuals have preferences over all bundles of goods. They also have endowments or incomes defined by the prices of the goods, and this determines what is feasible for them, and the set of feasible bundles constitutes their budget set. Choosing the best commodity bundle within their budget set determines their demand at each price vector. The question as to whether a mechanism exists to drive prices to the equilibrium has become secondary==

> The extent to which ==the analogy between physics and economics has ensnared economics in a position that it could have avoided had it found its source of inspiration elsewhere—for example, in biology==, as Marshall suggested—is well documented by these authors.

> ==What should interest us as economists is not only how informationally demanding the mechanism is at equilibrium but also how much information it requires to get there.==

> One could argue that the most important question that disappeared as the perfectly competitive model came to dominate the neoclassical scene was ==who sets the prices? The fiction of an “auctioneer” is not an adequate description for many markets,== and the basic problem of where prices come from is only treated, and this is significant, in what are described as models of “imperfect competition.

> Friedrich Hayek (1989) suggested that organization, or “order,” is an emergent phenomenon and argued that what is known as the market, in modern terms, was but one form of spontaneous order

> The computational complexity of two classes of market mechanisms is compared. First the Walrasian interpretation in which prices are centrally computed by an auctioneer. Recent results on the computational complexity are reviewed. The non-polynomial complexity of these algorithms makes Walrasian general equilibrium an implausible conception. Second, a decentralised picture of market processes is described, involving concurrent exchange within transient coalitions of agents

> A more practical motivation of this paper arises from a class of market models known as agent-based artificial markets. In agent-based computational models a population of software objects is instantiated and each agent is given certain internal states (e.g., preferences, endowments) and rules of behaviour (e.g., seek
> utility improvements)

> ==An important aspect of these agent market models is the price formation process.== 1 Through the interactions of the agents prices emerge in such models, either mediated by middlemen or market makers or not. In financial market models, agents use past prices to form idiosyncratic forecasts of future prices, and trade accordingly. New prices are created. Over time forecasting rules evolve, unprofitable ones are replaced by speculative ones, and the population of agents co-evolves to one another.

They are even unaware of the numbers of other agents, and they are ignorant about the actions of others.

> autonomous agents endowed with a stock of goods seek out partners, negotiate a price, and then trade with the agent offering the best deal. Different trade networks are imposed on the system by restricting the set of individuals with whom an agent can communicate.

> For example, Albin and Foley (1992) model a world in which traders broadcast their interest in trade, potential partners respond, and  agents trade if a mutually beneficial price can be negotiated.

> Epstein and Axtell (1996) construct a simulation that incorporates production and exchange. In their world, mobile individual agents collect (harvest) two different goods needed for their survival. And, if agents meet one another they can trade. For example, while the average price in their local market was usually close to the price that equated aggregate supply and aggregate demand, it did not remain at that price over time. Local price differences were persistent.

> Axtell (1998) explores the relative complexity of bilateral exchange versus a Walrasian world. Viewing a market as a social computer, he compares the computational  burden, measured by the number of calculations needed to find an equilibrium price, of each system. As the number of agents and commodities increases, he finds that the bilateral exchange process is less costly than a Walrasian system.
