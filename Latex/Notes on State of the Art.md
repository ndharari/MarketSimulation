For ease of analysis, his investors had been identical; they responded to market signals all in the same way and on average correctly, and Lucas had managed to show mathematically how a stock’s price over time would vary with its recent sequence of earnings.

I called it “complexity economics.” Looking back now, the features of complexity economics are clear. The economy is not necessarily in equilibrium; in fact it is usually in nonequilibrium. Agents are not all knowing and perfectly rational; they must make sense of the situations they are in and explore strategies as they do this. The economy is not given, not a simple container of its  echnologies; it forms from them and changes in structure as this happens. In this way the economy is organic, one layer forms on top of the previous ones

It asked not how agents’ behaviors would react to the aggregate patterns these created, but what behaviors (actions, strategies, expectations) would be upheld by—would be consistent with—the aggregate patterns these caused. It asked, in other words, what patterns would call for no changes in micro-behavior, and would therefore be in stasis, or equilibrium. (

Since we could arrange that an algorithm halt if its output fulfilled some particular set of mathematical conditions or reached a given “solution,” in general we cannot tell that that will be the case either. In other words there is no analytical method to decide in advance what a given algorithm will do

> We can now begin to see how such phenomena—or order, or structures, if you like—connect with complexity. Complexity, as I said, is the study of the consequences of interactions; it studies patterns, or structures, or phenomena, that emerge from interactions among elements—particles, or cells, or dipoles, or agents, or firms.

The economy is a complex system with nonlinear interactions and feedback loops.

of large movements, similar to critical transitions that are so characteristic for complex evolving systems. These large changes of global financial markets can hardly be viewed as a rational response to news about economic fundamentals and cannot be explained by traditional representative rational agent macro-finance models.

The most important difference between economics and the natural sciences is perhaps the fact that decisions of economic agents today depend upon their expectations or beliefs about the future

The predictions, expectations or beliefs of consumers, firms and investors about the future state of the economy are part of the “law of motion.”

Since the introduction of rational expectations by Muth (1961) and its popularization in macroeconomics by Lucas (1972a and b) and others, the rational expectations hypothesis (REH) became the dominating expectations formation paradigm in economics. According to the REH all agents are rational and take as their subjective expectation of future variables the objective prediction by economic theory. In economic modeling practice, expectations are given as the mathematical conditional expectation given all available information. Rational agents do not make “systematic mistakes” and their expectations are, on average, correct. The REH provides an elegant “fixedpoint” solution to an economic expectations feedback system by imposing that, on average, expectations and realizations coincide.

But how can agents have rational expectations or perfect foresight in a complex, nonlinear world, when the true law of motion is unknown and prices and quantities move irregularly on a strange attractor exhibiting sensitivity to initial conditions? A boundedly rational world view with agents using simple forecasting strategies

common assumption underlying models of bounded rationality is that agents do not know the actual “law of motion” of the economy, but instead base their forecasts upon time series observations. They behave like economic statisticians, forming expectations based upon time series observations, using a simple statistical model for their
perceived law of motion. Adaptive learning, sometimes also referred to as statistical learning, means that agents adapt their beliefs over time by updating the parameters of their perceived law of motion according to some learning scheme

This book focusses on “simple” complexity models, where only a few different types of heterogeneous agents interact. Our main focus is on the role of behavioral rationality and heterogeneous expectations within stylized complexity models. Our consistency story of bounded rationality contains three important elements: (i) agents use simple decision rules, with an intuitive behavioral interpretation; (ii) agents switch between different decision rules based on evolutionary selection and learning; and (iii) the models of bounded rationality are empirically validated, at both the micro and the macro levels.

Two forms of learning further discipline the class of decision heuristics. First, we use the heterogeneous strategy switching framework of Brock and Hommes (1997a, 1998) of endogenous evolutionary selection or reinforcement learning among heterogeneous decision or forecasting rules. The main idea here is that agents tend to switch to rules that have performed better

The forecasting rules may be divided into different classes, with different degrees of rationality, ranging from simple behavioral rules such as naïve or adaptive expectations, trend extrapolating rules or contrarian rules, to more sophisticated rules, such as statistical learning rules, fundamental market analysis or even rational expectations. These more sophisticated rules may be more costly – due to information-gathering costs – than alternative forecasting heuristics

###### cobweb model

The simplest economic example nicely illustrating the role of expectations feedback is the “hog cycle” or cobweb model.

The model is partial equilibrium and describes an independent competitive marketfor a non-storable consumption good, such as corn or hogs. Production takes a fixed unit of time, and suppliers therefore have to base their production decision upon their anticipation or expectation pe t of the market equilibrium price pt

A simple behavioral model, with agents gradually switching to better performing heuristics, explains individual, as well as emergent, macro behavior in these laboratory economies.

We explore families of heuristicrules for individual price-setting behavior and the resulting market patterns, through sim-ulations of agent-based models and laboratory experiments

Overall, the individual pricingstrategies observed experimentally can be represented approximately by a sales-basedsimple rule. In the experiments, average market prices tend to converge from above andapproach a state resembling a steady state, with slow aggregate price variations and lowprice dispersion around an average near the competitive level

IntroductionThe Bertrand–Edgeworth (BE) oligopoly, where price-setting, capacity-constrained firms compete for customers, providesa fair approximation of several markets, especially in the retail sector.1The basic form of that scenario is easily described. Ina “Marshallian short-run”, where the number of suppliers and their respective productive sizes are given, each firm operatesunder constant marginal costs, up to the bound established by a capacity constraint which determines a maximum volumeof goods which can be produced or kept in store. These firms post prices that signal their willingness to sell, conditional onthe capacity restriction, to customers who seek to buy at the lowest available price and who, to focus the analysis on thebehavior of firms, can be assumed to know all posted prices a

We consider the market for a non-storable good. Supply is generated by N firms, subject to a constant unit cost and a fixedupper limit on production. For the sake of the analysis, firms are assumed to be identical in their cost and maximum-outputparameters. Sellers post prices before the beginning of the market period, knowing only their own past decisions (prices)and performance (sales, profits). As a simplifying assumption, firms are not informed about the variables pertaining to theircompetitors.5Also

use them. The first of these heuristic rules consists ofa straightforward reaction to realized sales, by raising the price if the quantity demanded in the last period has reached thecapacity limit, and lowering the price in the opposite case. The ot

isan attractor for average prices.Thus, this simple heuristics generates a movement to a “dynamic equilibrium” where the system shows a permanentvariability of individual prices, while the average price and volume of sales gravitates towards a constant value.
